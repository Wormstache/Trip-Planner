                <span>Annapurna Circuit is a trek within the Annapurna mountain range of central
                    Nepal.The total length of the route varies between 160â€“230 km (100-145 mi), depending on where motor
                    transportation is used and where the trek is ended. This trek crosses two different river valleys
                    and
                    encircles the Annapurna massif. The path reaches its highest point at Thorung La pass (5416m/17769
                    ft),
                    touching the edge of the Tibetan plateau.</span>

                <span>Practically all trekkers hike the route anticlockwise, as this way the daily altitude gain is
                    slower, and
                    crossing the high Thorong La pass is easier and safer. The mountain scenery, seen at close quarters
                    includes
                    the Annapurna Massif (Annapurna I-IV), Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchhre, Manaslu, Gangapurna, Tilicho Peak,
                    Pisang
                    Peak, and Paungda Danda. Numerous other peaks of 6000-8000m in elevation rise from the Annapurna
                    range. The
                    trek begins at Besisahar or Bhulbhule in the Marshyangdi river valley and concludes in the Kali
                    Gandaki
                    Gorge. Besisahar can be reached after a seven-hour drive from Kathmandu.</span>
